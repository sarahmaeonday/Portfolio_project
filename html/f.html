<p><b>Ganjang gaejang (soy sauce marinated raw crab)</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b>
<ul>
	<li>4 to 5 medium-sized ggot-gae (Korean blue crabs)|</li>
    <li>500ml joseon ganjang (traditional soy sauce)</li>
    <li>1.2L water</li>
    <li>300ml cheongju (clear rice wine), or cooking sak√© or vodka</li>
    <li>1  large baechu (korean cabbage), cut into 4cm pieces.</li>
    <li>1 large mu (radish), cut into 4cm pieces</li>
    <li>1 bae (Asian pear), sliced thickly</li>
    <li>1 large onion, cut into about 6 pieces
    <li>1 large daepah (giant green onion), cut into about 6 pieces</li>
    <li>1 dried red chilli</li>
    <li>10 gamcho (liquorice root) slices</li>
    <li>1 piece ginger, about half the size of your thumb</li>
 </ul>
	<p>Directions</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Clean individual ggot-gae with a brush (I used an old toothbrush). Brush them thoroughly and pay extra attention to the belly side. Open the belly shell gently without breaking it, and brush the inside where the gills are under cold running water.
    <li>Dice your vegetables as explained above in the ingredients section.</li>
    <li> Place crabs in a strainer belly side down to drain out any moisture. Leave about 10 minutes. Once most of the water has drained, place crabs belly up in a large bowl and pour the cheongju onto them. Let them sit in the fridge.4. Meanwhile, add water, ganjang, and your cut vegetables to a stock pot and bring it to a boil. Once it comes to a full boil, simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until you can taste the sweet flavors from the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Take the crabs out of the refrigerator, pour the cheongju out into the simmering stock pot, and simmer for 30 more minutes. Put the crabs back into the refrigerator.
    <li>Strain the stock and cool it completely (try an ice bath). NB: It should not be room temperature, it needs to be cold. This will be your marinade.</li>
    <li>Cool the marinade again as in step 6, pour over the belly-up crabs and put them back into the refrigerator again for 2 more days.>
