	<li>1 cup of zucchini, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
	<li>1 cup of potato, peeled and cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
	<li>1½ cups of onion chunks</li>

	<li>Pour out the excess pork fat.</li>

     <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
     <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>
     <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
