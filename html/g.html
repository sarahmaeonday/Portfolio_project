    <li>120 g cabbage (4.3 ounces), thinly shredded</li>
    <li>35 g brown onion (1.2 ounces), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>6 mussels (200 g / 7 ounces) or more, cleaned</li>
    <li>6 littleneck clams (70 g / 2.5 ounces) or more, cleaned</li>
    <li>6 large prawns (140 g / 5 ounces) or more, head & shells removed and tail left on, cleaned</li>
    <li>6 squid rings or baby octopus, (70 g / 2.5 ounces)</li>
    <li>450 g fresh Korean-Chinese style noodles or thin udon noodles or ramen noodles (14 ounces)</li>
    <li>20 g baby spinach or baby bok choy (0.7 ounces)</li> 
</ul>
	<p>CHILI OIL SEASONING</p>
	<ul>
	<li>3 Tbsp cooking oil , I used rice bran oil</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp korean chili flakes (gochugaru), can be adjusted to your preferred spice level.</li>
    <li>(3 Tbsp gives only a mildly spicy flavor.)</li>
    <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
    <li>20 g green onion – white part (0.7 ounces</li>
</ul>
	<p>SOUP BASE</p>
	<ul>
	<li>1 Tbsp rice wine</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce , regular (kikkoman)</li>
    <li>4 3/4 cups Korean soup stock or water</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp fine sea salt , can be adjusted to your taste</li>
    <li>A few sprinkles ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
	<p>Directions</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Preheat a wok (or large deep pot) on low heat until heated. Add the oil, Korean chili flakes, minced garlic, minced ginger and the green onion and stir constantly for a minute or two. Take care not to burn the chili paste as this can give a bitter taste.</li>



     <li>Turn the heat up to medium and add the zucchini, mushrooms, cabbage, and onion. Cook them until lightly wilted (for 1 to 2 mins). Add the mussels, littleneck clams, prawns and squid (or baby octopus) and stir a bit.</li>



     <li>Add the rice wine, soy sauce and Korean soup stock (or water). Turn the heat up to medium high. Boil the soup covered until all ingredients are cooked through (about 8 mins) while avoiding overcooking. Remove the cover and add the salt and a few sprinkles of ground black pepper. Add the baby spinach just before serving. (If using baby bok choy, you may need to cook a little longer.)</li>


     <li>While the soup is boiling (in step 3), cook the noodles in boiling water following the manufacturer’s instructions. Drain and rinse the noodles briefly in cold water. (Step 3 and 4 should be completed around the same time.)</li>



     <li>Divide the noodles, seafood, and the soup between three soup bowls. Serve immediately. (If you prefer, you can also serve the soup with steamed rice instead of the noodles.)</li>
